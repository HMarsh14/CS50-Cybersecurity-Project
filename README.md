## Overview
This project is a presentation on the topic of the Microsoft Storm-2372 Phishing Attack, beginning August 2024. The slideshow in the video is made by myself, and the voiceover is an AI generated voiceover based on a script that I wrote and provided. The video discusses what led to the attack, what happened as a result, and also discusses how we, as a worldwide community, can prevent attacks like this from happening in the future.
